# CFB Story Time App

A college football content site that uses data to tell a story that the blue bloods can't beat!

## About

Stories are woven into every fabric of our being, so deeply ingrained in our psyche that we are moved to action by some of the master story tellers. One could also argue that College Football is ingrained in the blood of every American across the United States to an extent - even if you aren't into sports, you still root for your alma mater when they are playing the big rival on the last Saturday in November. So story telling and college football go hand-in-hand, like a middle school couple hanging out under the bleachers at your local high school football game.

I am using the Django Polls tutorial as a stepping off point for an app that I've been wanting to make for a little while now. Using the polls application, the CFB Story Time App will feel the vibrations coming out from all over the country and catch the buzz on how fans feel during the season. We'll have our own fans top 25 ranking or something cool like that.

Mainly I want to create a cool website that puts out awesome content using story telling principles and tools to take data and visualize it in an appealing and fun way to tell the greatest story of all time - the story of college football! Being a college football nerd my whole life, this is the perfect project for me to take on and use Python to create an awesome CFB Story Telling website - and maybe sell merchandise and stuff.... 

## App Planning

Here are things that need to be done for this application:

- [ ] The polls page sucks - need to style it, add header, sidebar(maybe), hero, content, newsletter section, footer, etc.....

- [ ] The actual poll page needs to be tightened up and more content needs to be added here to explain the poll. Also add a comments section
